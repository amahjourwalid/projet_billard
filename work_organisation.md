In our plan we will follow the tasks  bellow to presenting our project.  

Square case:

1: Creating a simulation of a pool containing just one ball, the purpose is to make a videos showing  it's trajectory, for that we will proceed with two different methods, first one using (matplotlib), and the second using (TKinter ).
 2: Making of a code that will count the times that the ball hit the counters and save it in a string (h) for horizontal and (v) for vertical.
 3: Making a statistical analysis for different set of the string

Flat Torus case:

Make the same things that we did in the square case but instead of choosing a square pool we will be working with a Flat Torus.

Elliptic case:

Making an animated video as the video in the link below:

Tasks repartition:
The first step presenting by AMGHAR Cherif talk about the plan of our project also the creation of a simple case of square Billiard, the second step presenting by AAMAHJOUR Walid talk about the creation of a function who lists words and the creation of a flat torus billiard, the last step presenting by CHEROY LÃ©o talk about the elliptic case. 
To do this work we follow this strategy:
First: create a simple case of Billiard and the function who list the words.
Second: create a flat torus Billiard.
Third: we try to create an elliptic case.
